# bad_blackjack
Example of an bad blackjack console that can't be unit tested and would require a large change to add another player or add a feature.

This is used to compare against the good one found at https://github.com/Codablo/blackjack.

One thing worth noting is that the "bad one" is only bad because we say it's hard to change, carries tech debt, and is hard to test.  But this was written in less than an hour. If this was a POC (Proof of Concept) this would fit the bill perfectly and get me the funding needed to write a better version that would be in the hands of more people.

Some times quick and dirty is the awesome.  But, most of the time it isn't.
